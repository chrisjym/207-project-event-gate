## Overview:
This project acts like an alternative to Ticketmaster, allowing users to search for local events, view them through a calendar, and saving these events into memory for viewing at later times.

## Features:
- Users can create accounts with a personal username and password to be stored into local memory
- Users can search for events near them based on location
- Users can categorize the events they search for based on specific categories
- Users can view events in a calendar format, viewing events based off of date
